Bridges
=======

  Less sophisticated censors prevent users from accessing
  the Tor network by blocking connections to known relays.
  "Bridge relays" help these users access Tor by not being
  in the same public lists as normal relays.

  Sophisticated censors can only be circumvented with
  private obfuscated bridges.

  Because there is NOT a 100%  way to hide Tor, Whonix does
  NOT recommend using Tor if you fear detection.

    Finding Public Bridges
    ----------------------

      https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges

      If you can not reach the URL, send an email (from a
      gmail.com or yahoo.com account only) to
      bridges@torproject.org with "get bridges" in the
      message body.

    Private Obfuscated Bridges
    --------------------------

      A sophisticated user you trust -- outside the reach of
      the censors but accessible from your location -- must
      run a bridge service configured with obfsproxy 3 (to
      help avoid detection) and the option
      "PublishServerDescriptor 0" (to not be listed by The
      Tor Project). However, since even private obfuscated
      bridges can ultimately be detected, Whonix does NOT
      recommend using bridges if you fear detection.

      To use bridges, copy the two lines below and paste
      them into /etc/tor/torrc

UseBridges 1
ClientTransportPlugin obfs2,obfs3 exec /usr/bin/obfsproxy managed

      You must also add the IPs for your bridges. The
      following lines are an example of how it should look:

bridge 23.22.110.133:443
bridge 24.22.1.54:443
bridge obfs2 209.176.111.47:42105
bridge obfs3 199.241.31.96:12873


Firewall
========

  The option ReachableAddresses ADDR[/MASK][:PORT]
  restricts the ports and IPs that Tor attempts to connect
  through. Study the examples below.

  If your firewall blocks all ports but 80 and 443, copy the
  two lines below into /etc/tor/torrc

ReachableAddresses accept *:80
ReachableAddresses accept *:443

  If your firewall allows connections to everything inside
  net 99, rejects port 80 inside net 18, but otherwise
  accepts connections to port 80:

ReachableAddresses 99.0.0.0/8
ReachableAddresses reject 18.0.0.0/8:80
ReachableAddresses accept *:80


Proxy
=====

  If you use an HTTP, SOCKS 4, or SOCKS 5 proxy to connect to
  the internet, study the examples below and configure
  /etc/tor/torrc accordingly.

  Note, you need to use the IP instead of the hostname
  (proxy.example.com). This may result in subtle differences
  your proxy may detect. See also Whonix documentation:
  https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnel_Tor_through_proxy_or_VPN_or_SSH#Tunnel_Tor_through_proxy


    HTTP Proxy
    ----------
      If you use an HTTP proxy at 192.168.1.44 via port 443

HTTPSProxy 192.168.1.44:443

      If it requires a username and password

HTTPSProxyAuthenticator username:password


    SOCKS 4
    -------
      To use a SOCKS 4 proxy at 10.0.1.3 via port 1080

Socks4Proxy 10.0.1.3:1080


    SOCKS 5
    -------
      To use a SOCKS 5 proxy at 172.1.3.3 via port 1080

Socks5Proxy 172.1.3.3:1080

      If it requires a username and password

Socks5ProxyUsername username
Socks5ProxyPassword password


Hidden Services
===============

  To make a service on Whonix-Workstation accessible over
  Tor, you must assign a directory and port for it inside
  Whonix-Gateway's /etc/tor/torrc. Below are examples that
  you can copy to /etc/tor/torrc

  For a longer tutorial, see:
  https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services


    Web Server
    ----------

      If a web server is running in Whonix-Workstation, add
      the next two lines to /etc/tor/torrc to make it
      accessible to others.

HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/webserver/
HiddenServicePort 80 192.168.0.11:80

      Find the .onion address for this service:
          sudo cat /var/lib/tor/webserver/hostname
      Backup /var/lib/tor/webserver/private_key


    TorChat
    -------

HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/torchat/
HiddenServicePort 11009 192.168.0.11:11009

      Find the .onion address for this service:
          sudo cat /var/lib/tor/torchat/hostname
      Backup /var/lib/tor/torchat/private_key


    Mumble Server
    -------------

HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/mumble/
HiddenServicePort 80 192.168.0.11:80

      Find the .onion address for this service:
          sudo cat /var/lib/tor/mumble/hostname
      Backup /var/lib/tor/mumble/private_key
